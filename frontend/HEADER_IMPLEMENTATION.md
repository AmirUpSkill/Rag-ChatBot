# Header Component Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a dynamic header component with theme toggle functionality and authentication state integration.

## Files Created

### 1. Theme Provider (`components/providers/theme-provider.tsx`)
- Context-based theme management
- Supports dark, light, and system theme preferences
- Persists theme choice to localStorage
- Provides `useTheme` hook for components

### 2. Theme Toggle Component (`components/shared/theme-toggle.tsx`)

- Smooth transitions between themes
- Accessible with screen reader support

### 3. User Avatar Component (`components/shared/user-avatar.tsx`)

- Dropdown menu with user information
- Logout functionality
- Only renders when user is authenticated

### 4. Header Component (`components/shared/header.tsx`)
- Sticky header with backdrop blur effect
- Responsive design (hides branding on mobile)
- Integrates theme toggle and authentication state
- Shows "Sign In" button for unauthenticated users
- Shows user avatar for authenticated users

### 5. Auth Provider (`components/providers/auth-provider.tsx`)
- Initializes authentication state on app load
- Automatically fetches user data if session exists

## Files Modified

### 1. Root Layout (`app/layout.tsx`)
- Added ThemeProvider wrapper
- Added AuthProvider wrapper
- Added `suppressHydrationWarning` to prevent theme hydration issues
- Configured default theme as dark with system preference support

### 2. Landing Page (`app/page.tsx`)

## Features

### Authentication Integration
- ✅ Displays appropriate UI based on auth state
- ✅ Sign In button for guest users

- ✅ User information display (name, email)
- ✅ Logout functionality
- ✅ Auto-fetches user on app load

### Responsive Design
- ✅ Sticky header that stays on top
- ✅ Backdrop blur effect
- ✅ Mobile-friendly (hides branding on small screens)
- ✅ Proper spacing and alignment

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. **Test Theme Toggle:**
   - Click the sun/moon icon in the header
   - Verify smooth transition between themes
   - Check that preference is saved (refresh page)

3. **Test Authentication Flow:**
   - As guest: See "Sign In" button
   - Click "Sign In" to trigger Google OAuth
   - After auth: See user avatar
   - Click avatar to see dropdown with user info
   - Test logout functionality

4. **Test Responsiveness:**
   - Resize browser window
   - Check mobile view (< 768px)
   - Verify header remains functional

## Usage Example

```tsx
import { Header } from "@/components/shared/header";

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      {/* Page content */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Notes

- The theme provider uses the `class` attribute strategy (required for Tailwind dark mode)
- Auth state is automatically initialized on app mount
- Avatar fallback uses the first letter of user's name or email
- All components are client-side ("use client") for interactivity
- TypeScript types are properly defined throughout

## Next Steps

Potential enhancements:
- Add navigation links to header
- Add search functionality
- Add notifications icon
- Add user settings page link
- Add mobile menu for navigation
